### CPSC 120
 
* Lab 2
 
   Lab 2, Part 3 was a favorite because it was a nice introduction to formatting and cleaning things up to make the code tidy. It utilized a classic Hello World file which was nice to see as I really liked learning to code that, as it was a nice introduction to what we would be working with in the class and in this field. This lab part was definitely a fun one to do.
 
* Lab 6
 
   Lab 6, Part 1 was another really good one that I enjoyed doing. It was fun trying to figure out how to get the loop for the pattern working properly and after many attempts, figuring it out right at the end of class was so satisfying and seeing it all come together was a treat. It was a fun lab for sure and I enjoyed working with loops on it.
 
* Lab 12
 
   Lab 12, Part 1 is the last lab I will be talking about and the last lab of the class. The goal for part 1 was to make a gradient animated image or GIF and it was really fun to do and really nice to see the end result. I hadnt really thought about what goes behind the creation of one of these animated images and seeing how it works with the RGB and everything coming together was really fascinating. I enjoyed figuring things out and correcting that final error we had in which the red and green layers motions were swapped but we were able to quickly correct it and the result was really cool to see.
